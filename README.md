# The Creative Independent's Chrome Extension
A new tab Chrome extension that pulls quotes from The Creative Independent.

## Quote API
The extension pulls a random quote from [this route](https://thecreativeindependent.com/api/v1/quotes.json) on TCI. The quote API generates 50 random pull quotes or highlights from interview posts.

## Offline mode
The extension will fallback to the `fallback_quotes.js` if the user is offline.

## Night mode
There is a built in dark mode theme from 7pm to 5am.

## Deployment
The extension is deployed to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-creative-independent%E2%80%99/hfpihhnbilfkcjakaeopanccjlcnnefp) and also available in this repo.
